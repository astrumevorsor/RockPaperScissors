# Rock Paper Scissors
A fun interpretation of rock paper scissors.

I will keep updating this as I learn full stack web development. As of today, I know the basics of HTML, CSS and beginner Javascript. After years of fighting mental health issues, this is a first step to achieving my goals. 
What I learned: 
1. CSS Animations
2. Javascript Styling
3. Javascript variables and functions
4. Using images in websites
5. How to code clean and efficient
